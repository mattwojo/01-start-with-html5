# Semantic Principals of Advanced HTML5, Exploring Local Storage and AppCache
This is a short exploration of applying Semantic HTML5 containers and utilizing Local Storage and AppCache. Craig Grant and Matt Wojciakowski contributed ideas and this project appears in several other iterations throughout our Code Fellows Cohort as a place of experimentation. I will post the various iterations here soon...

When a pull request is initiated, I will be notified of the update and comment on the submitted assignment via Github tools.

## Keeping your local repo up to date
Your local repo will be an independent version of the original repo from the moment you fork the repo. In order to keep your local repo up to date with the original repo, you need to do what is called an [upstream pull][3].

To manage an upstream pull, I suggest updating your `.bash_profile` and your `.gitconfig` file with easy to remember aliases.

### .bash_profile

In your `.bash_profile` add the following alias

```
alias upstream="git remote add upstream \$@"
```

From the command line you simply need to refer to the alias and add the path to the upstream repo as shown in the following example.

```
$ upstream https://github.com/blackfalcon/unicorn-class-css-section.git
```

Once the upstream repo is configured for your local repo, this never needs to be reset again, unless you delete your local repo.

### .gitconfig
In your `.gitconfig` add the following alias

```
[alias]
  pu = !"git fetch origin -v; git fetch upstream -v; git merge upstream/master"
```

From the command line, within the project repo, enter the following command to pull latest code from the upstream master.

```
git pu
```
